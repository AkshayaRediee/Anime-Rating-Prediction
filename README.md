**Anime Rating Prediction Project**

 *Project Overview*

This project focuses on analyzing anime-related data and building a machine learning model to predict anime ratings based on various features such as popularity, number of episodes, and user engagement metrics. The goal is to apply data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract insights and evaluate model performance.

*Problem Statement*

Anime ratings are influenced by multiple factors including audience size, content type, and user interactions. Understanding these factors can help identify patterns that contribute to higher ratings. This project aims to explore these relationships and develop a predictive model for anime ratings.

*Objective*

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the anime dataset

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict anime ratings

Compare model performance using standard regression metrics

*Dataset Description*

The dataset contains information about various anime titles, including:

Number of episodes

Popularity and engagement metrics

Anime type and rating category

User-generated rating scores

The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare it for modeling.

*Tools & Technologies Used*

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Version Control: Git & GitHub

*Data Preprocessing*

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Selected relevant numerical and categorical features

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of ratings and key features

Examined relationships between popularity metrics and ratings

Visualized trends using plots and charts to identify patterns

*Modeling Approach*

Implemented regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

Used a preprocessing pipeline to ensure consistent data transformation

Trained models on the training dataset and evaluated them on the test dataset

*Model Evaluation*

Model performance was evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score

These metrics were used to compare model accuracy and predictive performance.

*Results & Findings*

The Random Forest model performed better than the baseline regression model

Popularity and engagement-related features showed stronger influence on ratings

The model was able to capture non-linear relationships in the data

*Conclusion*

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict anime ratings. The results highlight the importance of feature engineering and model selection in improving prediction accuracy.
